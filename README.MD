# Comprehensive OPL CFG Collection

This repository is a comprehensive collection of configuration files (CFG) for **Open PS2 Loader (OPL)**. It has been compiled from several sources to create a single, robust database that enriches your OPL experience with extensive game information.

### Key Features
* **Combined Database:** This collection merges CFG files from multiple repositories, minimizing duplicates and maximizing the number of supported games.
* **Rich Game Information:** Many files include details like game titles, descriptions, genres, release dates, developers, ratings, and the number of players.
* **Easy to Use:** The files are ready to be imported into OPL Manager, allowing you to quickly update your entire game database.
